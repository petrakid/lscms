# Luthersites CMS
The official Luthersites CMS

Introduction to this CMS

For too long churches of both small and large have struggled to have a good web presence as an affordable cost.  Even in my own ministry and my own corner of the world, many of the local churches -- churches within 50 miles of me -- either don't have or can't have a website.

Luthersites CMS hopes to resolve this issue by offering a well-maintained and easy-to-use CMS for churches.  Here are a few features:

 -- Secure website
 -- Easy to manage
 -- Lots of features beneficial for churches
 -- Hosted on a great server in the USA
 -- LOW cost!
 
 Version 2.5.5:
 -- includes the latest Bootstrap
 -- includes the latest Material Design for Bootstrap
 -- includes the latest CKEditor and ResponsiveFileManager
 -- Further cleaning up of old code, files, and folders
 -- Moved the administrative menu to its own php file and its own table in the DB
